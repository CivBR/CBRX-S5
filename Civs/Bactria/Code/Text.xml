Renowed for your military prowess, never once were you defeated in battle, and hailed as a second Alexander, you launched expeditions into well beyond the Indus river; there, a new Indo-Greek kingdom would be formed, combining Hellenistic culture and Buddhism.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Great King! Untold glories unfold themselves as new exotic horizons open up on these new lands; will you once more take command of the Greeks, and the Bactrians, and Indians and whomever else dares be brave enough to follow you into battle?

			<Text>The Greco-Bactrian Kingdom was the easternmost part of the Hellenistic world, covering Bactria and Sogdiana in Central Asia from 250 to 125 BC. It was centered around the north of present-day Afghanistan. The expansion of the Greco-Bactrians into present-day northern India and Pakistan from 180 BC established the Indo-Greek Kingdom, which was to last until around 10 AD.</Text>
