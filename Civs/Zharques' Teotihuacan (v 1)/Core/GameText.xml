			<Text>Teotihuacan is the name given by the Nahuatl-speaking Aztecs to the city and civilization that dominated the Mexican Highlands at its height. Divided into four periods, Teotihuacan is known today as the site of many of the most architecturally significant Mesoamerican pyramids built in the pre-Columbian Americas, namely the Pyramid of the Sun and the Pyramid of the Moon. Apart from the pyramids, Teotihuacan is also anthropologically significant for its complex, multi-family residential compounds, the Avenue of the Dead, and its vibrant, well-preserved murals. Additionally, Teotihuacan exported fine obsidian tools found throughout Mesoamerica.</Text>

			<Text>First signs of settlement in Teotihuacan trace back to around 600 BC. Very little is known of the era, as the city was merely a collection of scattered, small villages, and the population of the valley was a mere 6,000 people. During this time, Teotihuacan was far from a dominant city, with a competitor being the city of Cuicuilco. However, eruptions of Xitle and Popocatepetl saw Teotihuacan become a place with lots of very fertile ash, and wiped out Cuicuilco with lava. Teotihuacan gets its first major influx of people from refugees fleeing the ruins of Cuicuilco. During Period I, Teotihuacan became a true multiethnic city. Many of the classic Maya/Aztec gods got their earliest form here, but the principle deity emerges being the Great Goddess of Teotihuacan.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_PEDIA_ZRQ_TEO_SPEAROWL_TEXT_3">
			<Text>Period II begins in 1 AD and lasted until 150 AD. During this era, Teotihuacan exhibited explosive growth and emerged as the largest metropolis in Mesoamerica.  The first few big monuments are built around this time, being the Temple of the Feathered Serpent and the Ciudadela. Within the Ciudadela is where a bunch of sacrifices were found in warrior garments, and underneath the Temple of the Feathered Serpent is a subchamber that was ostensibly a representation of the Teotihuacano understanding of the universe or the underworld. Period II is where the obsidian workshops really started taking off, which is believed to be their most important product, as the obsidian was sculpted and shaped. The word "Toltec" might originate as a term for 'An Artisan of the Highest Caliber' and that may have originated from them working in Obsidian workshops. Also during Period II is where the New Fire Ceremony is thought to originate.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_PEDIA_ZRQ_TEO_SPEAROWL_TEXT_4">
			<Text>Teotihuacan was growing, and that means that it needed bigger facilities. The second half of Period II is called the Miccaotl phase, Miccaotl being the word the aztecs gave to the Boulevard of the Dead, which runs right through the city. During this period the Boulevard of the Dead, and all of the temples, elite housing, and giant pyramids were built and upgraded. The Temple of the Serpent fell into disrepair in favor of the new and much larged Pyramids of the Sun and Moon, lots of noble housing was constructed, and the quarters started burgeoning. By now Teotihuacan was a city of approximately 100,000. It is during this period that a warlord named Siyah K'ak', Smoking Frog, or Fire is Born depending on what transliteration you adhere to, showed up in the city of Waka' with an army full of soldiers in heavily armored battle regalia. They said they were sent by the king of the biggest city anyone had ever heard of, Spearthrower Owl of Teotihuacan. The Maya King folded like wet paper and invited in his new Teotihuacano overlords. Waka' was about 1000km from Teotihuacan. Within the week, Fire Is Born had not only set up his base of operations in Waka', but he actually left it, conquered Tikal, and executed its king publically installing someone who said he was the son of Spearthrower Owl. Siyah K'ak' rewarded himself for his efforts and the regency he had over Tikal for a while with a smaller more insignificant citystate for his retirement.</Text>

			<Text>The Classic Period and the Woes of Period IV</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_PEDIA_ZRQ_TEO_SPEAROWL_TEXT_5">
			<Text>The 378 to around 650 is known as the Teotihuacano classic period. Throughout this period, there was more  monumentality, wealth, and exporting of Teotihuacano culture, with some of the Maya kings emulating Teotihuacano warriors and saying that they were born there. Teotihuacan reached a population of between 125k and 200k, making it the 6th largest city in the world at that time. There is evidence to suggest that the city's population stratified into three-ish castes. The High Elites, the Intermediate Elites, and the Laborers. The inner city seemed the gentrify and the outer city was associated with high infant mortality rates. Following the classical period came period IV. It is hard to say which of Teotihuacan's woes came first. Around 650ish you start seeing a lot of the inner city buildings getting burned and sacked. Originally, scholars thought this was evidence of invasion, now they mostly think it was peasant revolt caused by starvation, which itself was caused by a series of climate changes and droughts and even another volcanic eruption in the 570s. Teotihuacan would have been unable to support its armies, and around this time you see their military influence recede. The centres  of Cholula, Xochicalco, and Cacaxtle started to jockey for power and may have even banded together to weaken Teotihuacan further. And thus, the city starved. The fall itself came sometime between 650 and 750AD, the city being abandoned to everyone but Aztec hermits shortly after.</Text>

			<Text>Spearthrower Owl, was a Mesoamerican person from the Early Classic period, who is identified in Maya inscriptions and iconography. While very little is known about him, most archeological evidence suggests that Spearthrower Owl was a ruler of Teotihuacan at the start of the height of its influence across Mesoamerica in the 4th and 5th century, and that he was responsible for an intense period of Teotihuacan presence in the Maya area, including the conquest of Tikal in 378 CE.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_LEADER_ZRQ_SPEAROWL_PEDIA_TEXT_2">
			<Text>Spearthrower Owl is a name invented by archaeologists to describe the Teotihuacan-originated spear-holding owl symbol, stylised as one or two Maya glyphs usually used to represent his name. One version of the ruler's name glyph shows a weapon, most likely an atlatl, combined with an owl sign. At Tikal, the name appears written once with phonetic elements, suggesting the Mayan version of the name is Jatz'om Kuy, "striker owl," or "owl that will strike". Various logographs or glyphs depicting an owl and a spear-thrower are documented in Teotihuacan and in the Maya cities of Tikal, Uaxactun, Yaxchilan, and Toniná. They may or may not refer to the same individual, or have other symbolic meanings.</Text>

			<Text>Maya inscriptions at several sites describe the arrival of strangers from the west, depicted with Teotihuacan-style garments and carrying weapons. These arrivals are connected to changes in political leadership at several of the sites. Stuart noted that the Marcador monument at the Petén Basin center of Tikal records Spearthrower Owl's ascension to the throne of an unspecified polity on a date equivalent to 4 May 374 CE. Monuments at El Perú, Tikal and Uaxactun describe the arrival of a personage Siyaj K'ak' somehow under the auspices of Spearthrower Owl in the month of January 378.</Text>

Tikal Stela 31 describes that in 379, a year after the arrival of Siyaj K'ak' at Tikal, Yax Nuun Ayiin, described as a son of Spearthrower Owl and not of the previous ruler Chak Tok Ich'aak, was installed as king of Tikal. His rule saw the introduction of Teotihuacan-style imagery in the iconography of Tikal. Stela 31 was erected during the reign of Yax Nuun Ayiin's son Siyaj Chan K'awil and describes the death of that ruler's grandfather, Spearthrower Owl, in 439 CE Spearthrower Owl was mentioned in later texts; for example, on a door lintel of Temple I where the Tikal ruler Jasaw Chan K'awiil I celebrated the thirteen k'atun anniversary of Spearthrower Owl's death when they "conjured the holy one."</Text>

			<Text>The Internalists and Externalists</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_LEADER_ZRQ_SPEAROWL_PEDIA_TEXT_5">
			<Text>The connection of Spearthrower Owl to Teotihuacan as well as the precise nature of Teotihuacan's influence on the Maya has been a hotly debated topic since the hieroglyphic texts first became fully readable in the 1990s. The controversy is related to the general discussion of central Mexican influence in the Maya area which was sparked by the findings of Teotihuacan-related objects in the early Maya site of Kaminaljuyú in the 1930s. The controversy has two sides. The internalist side argues for limited direct contact between Teotihuacan and the Maya area. This side has been represented by epigraphers such as Linda Schele and David Freidel who have argued that the Maya merely had friendly diplomatic relations with Teotihuacan which caused the Maya elite to emulate Teotihuacano culture and ideology. The externalist side argues that Teotihuacan was an important factor in the development of Maya culture and politics in the Classic period. This viewpoint was first associated with archaeologist William Sanders who argued for an extreme externalist viewpoint. But as more evidence of direct Teotihuacan influence in the Maya area surged at Copán and new hieroglyphic decipherments by epigraphers such as David Stuart interpreted Teotihuacan incursion as a military invasion, the externalist position was strengthened. In 2003, George Cowgill, an archaeologist specialising in Teotihuacan who had formerly espoused a mostly internalist perspective on Teotihuacan-Maya relations, summarised the debate, conceding that Teotihuacan had probably exercised some kind of political control in the Maya area in the early classic period and that left an important legacy into the late and epi-classic periods. In 2008 an interpretation of Spearthrower Owl-related iconography at Teotihuacan suggested that Spearthrower Owl was an important military god at Teotihuacan that had his given name to both a place known as "Spearthrower Owl Hill" and to the ruler mentioned in the Maya hieroglyphic texts.</Text>

			<Text>It is believed that Teotihuacan had four military orders: Bird, Dog or Canine, Snake, and Cat or Feline. The most promient of the orders were Bird and Dog. Teotihuacano warriors were professional soliders who wore a significant amount of armour. On the head was feathered, tasselled headdress, where the tassels would state the name, age, spirit animal, and accomplishments of the warrior. Over the eyes were magical war goggles, which evoked Tlaloc. On their back was a circular obsidian mirror shield strapped to the chest and back via a special kind of belt. This was fringed with feathers and banded with pyrite. The feathers were from an owl originally, meant to infuse the warrior with the speed of nature's slowest bird. Additional, three layered capes that did not cover up the mirror. Strapped to the pectorals and arms were owl feathers. Around their neck was a collar made of plates of turtleshell, obsidian, and human bone. Over it all was the ehuatl, a heavy cotton tunic that is about two centimeters thick, soaked in seawater and dried to be made more rigid and sturdy, and which stopped projectiles. Throught the clothing and equipment were animal motifs. Carried were rectangular shields to be carried in the off-hand, atlatls, darts, and spears. The armour was incredibly big, bulky, and ritualized, reflecting the very ritual form of combat practiced by Teotihuacan and the belief that their armor would protect them against magical and divine threats as well as physical ones.</Text>

			<Text>Obsidian was a highly integrated part of daily and ritual life in Mesoamerican civilizations, and its widespread and varied use may be a significant contributor to Mesoamerica's lack of metallurgy.  Pre-Columbian Mesoamericans' use of obsidian was extensive and sophisticated; including carved and worked obsidian for tools and decorative objects. Mesoamericans also made a type of sword with obsidian blades mounted in a wooden body. Obsidian mirrors were used by some Aztec priests to conjure visions and make prophecies. They were connected with Tezcatlipoca, god of obsidian and sorcery, whose name can be translated from the Nahuatl language as 'Smoking Mirror'. Obsidian workshops started gaining prominence in Period II, and Teotihuacan maintained outposts near obsidian mines. Interestingly, the word "toltec" might originate as a term for 'An Artisan of the Highest Caliber' and that may have originated from them working in Obsidian workshops.</Text>

		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIV5_RESOURCE_ZRQ_OBSIDIAN_TEXT">
			<Text>Obsidian is a naturally occurring volcanic glass formed when lava extruded from a volcano cools rapidly with minimal crystal growth. It is an igneous rock. Sources in the Valley of Mexico, which fell under Teotihuacan control during the Early Classic, were Pachuca, Otumba, and Chicoloapan. Obsidian from Pachuca is notable because of its unique green-gold color and its internal purity which makes it one of the highest quality obsidian sources in Mesoamerica. It was much sought after and widely traded. During the Preclassic period, obsidian was a rare item in the lowland areas, found predominantly in high-status and ritual contexts. In many Maya excavations evidence of obsidian is likewise found most frequently in privileged settings. As the Late Classic period progressed, obsidian became increasingly accessible to the lower classes of Maya civilization. Nevertheless, the Maya upper classes continued to remain in possession of the more prestigious Teotihuacan green obsidian.</Text>
