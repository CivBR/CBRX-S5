Though the means of which your people have managed to grasp the rule of Lower Egypt for themselves have faded from history, the Hyksos left a decisive mark on Egyptian history as the first foreign people to have ruled as suzerains of the Nile, and the great improvements brought by them - mainly on the military - had everlasting impact on Egyptian history, as future dynasties would have the power to conquer, keep in check their asiatic neighbours, and prosper.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Oh faithful servant of Set, the God of the Desert has let the pass into Egypt open to the Hyksos yet again! Will you claim the riches of this blessed land, forming your own Dynasty to rule over the waters of the Nile? Can you build a civilization to stand the test of time?</Text>

			<Text>The Hyksos were a group of Asiatic people from Western Asia who took over the eastern Nile Delta, ending the Thirteenth Dynasty of Egypt and initiating the Second Intermediate Period. The Hyksos practiced horse burials, and their chief deity, their native storm god, the west-Semitic Baal, became associated with the Egyptian storm and desert god, Seth. The Hyksos brought several technical improvements to Egypt, as well as cultural infusions such as new musical instruments and foreign loan words. The changes introduced include new techniques of bronze working and pottery, new breeds of animals, and new crops. In warfare, they introduced the horse and chariot, the composite bow, improved battle axes, and advanced fortification techniques. Because of these cultural advances, Hyksos rule was decisive for Egypt’s later empire in the Middle East.</Text>

			<Text>Apophis was a ruler of Lower Egypt during the fifteenth dynasty and the end of the Second Intermediate Period that was dominated by this foreign dynasty of rulers called the Hyksos. Although his reign only entailed northern Egypt, Apepi was dominant over most of Egypt during the early portion of his reign, and traded peacefully with the native, Theban Seventeenth dynasty to the south. In the Ramesside era, he is recorded as worshiping Seth in a monolatric way: "He chose for his Lord the god Seth. He didn't worship any other deity in the whole land except Seth."</Text>

			<Text>The ranged Heqa-Khasuts are best employed offensively on sieges not only due to the fact that they're stronger than their non-unique counterparts, but also because they gain the ability to build Forts when within the limits of a conquered city.

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIV5_TCM_MEKTER_TEXT">
			<Text>Mekter is a broad term in Egyptian for forts. The Hyksos brought new fortification techniques to Egypt after installing their Dynasty on the north of the Nile. Due to this, and other military advancements that arrived in Egypt through the Hyksos, later native Egyptian dynasties would have the capacity to expand Egypt to it's greatest extent ever since.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_BUILDING_TCM_MEKTER_STRATEGY">
			<Text>The unique Hyksos Mekter allows players who have decided to rush unit production for early game conquest before building their Barracks to still receive the Experience bonuses from the building, as long as the Mekter was built in a conquered city. Alternatively, one could still build the Mekter in their home cities, and reap a total 30 experience bonus from this building; this would take longer, however.</Text>
