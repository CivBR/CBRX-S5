			<Text>Norte Chico potentially represents a unique reliance on maritime food sources in absence of a staple cereal. This thesis of a maritime foundation was contrary to the general scholarly consensus that the rise of civilization was based on intensive agriculture. Although this theory is largely based on early fieldwork done in the region of Aspero, it has continued to hold sway as the full scope and inter-connectedness of the several sites of the civilization has been realized. Although, current studies stress the role of agriculture in supporting industry and augmenting diet, the Norte Chico civilization still relied much more on maritime food sources than the other cradle civilizations (even if not as the primary source of sustenance). The remaining question is which of the areas, coastal or inland, developed first and created a template for subsequent development.</Text>

Workers would gather a long, durable grass known as shicra in the highlands above the city, tie the grass strands into loosely meshed bags, fill the bags with boulders, and then pack the trenches behind each successive retaining wall of the step pyramids with the stone-filled bags. In this way, the people of Norte Chico achieved formidable architectural success. The largest of the platforms mounds at Caral, the Piramide Mayor, measures 160 by 150 m and rises 18 m high.</Text>

			<Text>The labor mobilization patterns revealed by archaeological evidence at Norte Chico sites potentially point to a unique emergence of human government, one of two alongside Sumer.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Norte Chico polities were likely theocratic. Construction areas show possible evidence of feasting, which would have included music and likely alcohol, suggesting an elite able to both mobilize and reward the population. The degree of centralized authority is difficult to ascertain, but architectural construction patterns are indicative of an elite that, at least in certain places at certain times, wielded considerable power. While some of the monumental architecture was constructed incrementally, other buildings, such as the two main platform mounds at Caral, appear to have been constructed in one or two intense construction phases. The remains of large stone warehouses found at Upaca provide further evidence of centralized control as emblematic of authorities able to control vital resources such as cotton.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the Supe Valley there are indicators of social division, hierarchized strata, and the unequal distribution of the surplus produced. This includes houses differentiated by their location in the city, their size, and the materials used to build them; the work of specialists evidenced by geoglyphs, the quipu, and agricultural technology; the design and planned construction of the city; and the organization of multifunctional activities (social, economic, political, and religious), burials of children, differentiated by the social positions of their families. One sector of the population, benefiting from the trading, consolidated its power and leadership through religion, the production of knowledge, and the rendering of services.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There is a distinct absence of any suggestion of physical bases of power, such as defensive construction. There is no evidence of warfare of any kind or at any level during the preceramic Period. Mutilated bodies, burned buildings, and other tell-tale signs of violence are absent, and settlement patterns are completely non-defensive. The evidence of the development of complex government in the absence of warfare is in marked contrast to archaeological theory, which suggests that human beings move away from kin-based groups to larger units resembling states for mutual defense of often scarce resources. A vital resource was present: arable land generally, and the cotton crop specifically, but the move to greater complexity was apparently not driven by the need for defense or warfare.</Text>

			<Text>It is impossible to properly judge Norte Chico leadership; next to nothing is known concerning any one individual. For a preceramic culture they left behind impressive monumental and ceremonial architecture. Caral became an outstanding expression of urbanism. Not only was its political hegemony felt in its immediate surroundings, but it can also be inferred in architectural patterns present from the Chao Valley in the north to the Chill'n in the south. The disappearance of the Norte Chico culture is generally attributed more to its success than any specific source of decline. The cultural climate fostered the development of new irrigation techniques which allowed the inhabitants of the Caral-Super valley to move on to more fertile land better suited for advanced agriculture.</Text>

			<Text>Mighty father, honoured ancestor of the Sacred City of Caral, we come seeking your wisdom and guidance. Developing in the Andean rain shadow, Norte Chico would arise out of seemingly impossible conditions. Lacking fertile ground for agriculture and having yet to discover ceramics or writing, it nevertheless emerged as the first civilization of the Americas and established a culture that would continue to influence the great Andean empires to come. The city of Caral, in particular, would represent an outstanding expression of urbanism; a political hegemony felt not only in its immediate surroundings but also inferred in architectural patterns present from the Chao to the Chill'n Valleys. Yet, as your people grew, great leader, they would depart from the Peruvian coast and seek more arable land in the mountainous interior; abandoning the monumental cities which would be their legacy.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Qhapaq, long lost to the passage of time, there is still much not known about your people.

			<Text>The Norte Chico culture, more formally referred to as the Caral-Supe Civilization, was a pre-Columbian culture that developed on the north-central coast of what is today Peru. It has been established as the oldest known civilization in the Americas, flourishing between 3200-1800 BC, and one of the six sites where civilization independently originated in the ancient world. Norte Chico potentially represents a unique reliance on maritime food sources in absence of a staple cereal; however, current studies also stress the role of agriculture in supporting industry and augmenting diet. It is likely that Norte Chico was the cultural predecessor for many of the great subsequent Andean civilizations, such as the Chavin and Inca. </Text>

			<Text>The discovery of Norte Chico has shifted focus away from the highland areas of the Andes and lowlands adjacent to the mountains, where the Chavin and Inca had their major centers, to the Peruvian coast. This area would seem an unlikely candidate for the development of civilization compared to the other major cradle centers; the Peruvian coast is extremely arid, bounded by two rain shadows. However, the region is punctuated by more than fifty rivers that carry Andean snowmelt. The development of widespread irrigation from these water sources is seen as decisive in the emergence of Norte Chico, since all of the monumental architecture at various sites has been found close to irrigation channels.</Text>

			<Text>Radiocarbon analysis of samples taken in the Pativilca and Fortaleza areas provides limited indication of human settlement during the Pre-Columbian Early Archaic era as early as 9210 BC. Two dates of 3700 BC are associated with communal architecture, but are likely to be anomalous. It is from 3200 BC onward that large-scale human settlement and communal construction are clearly apparent. The earliest date securely associated with a city is 3500 BC, at Huaricanga, in the Fortaleza area of the north.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Norte Chico sites are notable for exceptional collective density, as well as individual size. The density of sites in such a small area is globally unique for such a nascent civilization. During the third millennium BC, Norte Chico may have been the most densely populated area of the world.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Data suggest that the development of coastal and inland sites occurred in parallel. But, from 2500 to 2000 BC, during the period of greatest expansion, the population and development decisively shifted toward the inland sites. All development apparently occurred at large interior sites such as Caral, though they remained dependent on fish and shellfish from the coast.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIVLOPEDIA_NORTE_CHICO_MOD_TEXT_4">
			<Text>The primary academic debate regarding Norte Chico is the degree to which the civilization was dependent on maritime food resources and the exact relationship this implies between the coastal and inland sites.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A broad outline of the Norte Chico diet suggests edible domesticated crops such as squash, beans, lucuma, guava, pacay, and camote. There was also a significant seafood component at both coastal and inland sites, with animal remains (the primary protein source) almost exclusively marine life. The anchovy fish, in particular, was a significant commodity at inland sites, while shellfish, sea mammals, and seaweed do not appear to have been significant portions of the diet at non-maritime sites.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The role of seafood in the Norte Chico diet has aroused significant debate. Early fieldwork was primarily done in the region of Aspero on the coast, before the full scope and inter-connectedness of the several sites of the civilization were realized.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The thesis of a maritime foundation, that a maritime subsistence economy had been the basis of the society and its early flourishing, is contrary to the general scholarly consensus that the rise of civilization was based on intensive agriculture, particularly of at least one cereal. The production of agricultural surpluses has long been seen as essential in promoting population density and the emergence of complex society. Concomitant to the maritime subsistence hypothesis was an implied dominance of sites immediately adjacent to the coast over other centers. This idea was shaken by the realization of the magnitude of Caral, an inland site.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Research then shifted from Aspero to Caral. New theories emphasized the dominance of agriculture and also suggested that Caral was the oldest urban center in Peru (and the entire Americas). It deprecated the idea that civilization might have begun adjacent to the coast and then moved inland. Rather than coastal antecedents to monumental inland sites, coastal settlements were now understood as satellite villages to monumental inland sites. However, though Caral was the largest and most complex preceramic site, it is not the oldest. Supporters of the maritime theory admitted the importance of agriculture to industry and to augment diet, while broadly affirming the formative role of marine resources in early Andean civilization.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Scholars now agree that the inland sites did have significantly greater populations, and were therefore dominant. The remaining question is which of the areas developed first and created a template for subsequent development.</Text>

			<Text>Cotton likely provided the basis for dominance of inland sites over coastal. Though not edible, it was the most important product of irrigation in the Norte Chico, vital to the production of fishing nets (that in turn provided maritime resources) as well as to textiles and textile technology. Control over cotton would allow a ruling elite to provide the benefit of cloth for clothing, bags, wraps, and adornment.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This would indicate a form of mutual dependence between the coastal and inland sites. The residents of the Norte Chico needed maritime resources for protein and the fishermen needed the cotton to make the nets to catch the fish. However, identifying cotton as a vital resource produced in the inland does not by itself resolve the issue of whether the inland centers were a progenitor for the coast or vice versa. The exact relationship between food resources and political organization remains unresolved.</Text>

			<Text>When compared to the common Eurasian models of the development of civilization, Norte Chico's differences are striking. A total lack of ceramics persists across the period; Norte Chico's people would have roasted their various crops, with no pots to boil them. The lack of pottery was accompanied by a lack of archaeologically apparent art; no sculpture, no carving or bas-relief, almost no painting or drawing with building interiors completely bare.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While the absence of ceramics appears anomalous, the presence of textiles is intriguing. As quipu, string-based recording devices, have been found at Caral, this suggests a writing, or proto-writing, system at Norte Chico. The exact use of quipu in this and later Andean cultures has been widely debated. Originally it was believed to be simply a mnemonic used to record numeric information, such as a count of items bought and sold. Evidence has emerged that the quipu may also have recorded logographic information in the same way writing does.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Other finds at Norte Chico have proved suggestive. While visual arts appear absent, the people may have played instrumental music: thirty-two flutes, crafted from pelican bone, have been discovered. The image of the Staff God on a gourd is another artifact that awaits explanation. While still fragmentary, such archaeological evidence corresponds to the patterns of later Andean civilization and may indicate that Norte Chico served as a template.</Text>

			<Text>Norte Chico potentially represents a unique reliance on maritime food sources in absence of a staple cereal. This thesis of a maritime foundation was contrary to the general scholarly consensus that the rise of civilization was based on intensive agriculture. Although this theory is largely based on early fieldwork done in the region of Aspero, it has continued to hold sway as the full scope and inter-connectedness of the several sites of the civilization has been realized. Although, current studies stress the role of agriculture in supporting industry and augmenting diet, the Norte Chico civilization still relied much more on maritime food sources than the other cradle civilizations (even if not as the primary source of sustenance). The remaining question is which of the areas, coastal or inland, developed first and created a template for subsequent development.</Text>

			<Text>An aquifer is an underground layer of water-bearing permeable rock or unconsolidated materials (gravel, sand, or silt) which acts as a reservoir for groundwater. Aquifers are filled with water from rain or melted snow that drains into the ground until it reaches a layers of less permeable rock. Wells drilled into aquifers provide water for drinking, agriculture, and industrial uses. However, aquifers can dry up if drained faster than they can naturally refill from precipitation.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Fossil Water is groundwater that has remained sealed in an aquifer for a long period of time. Water can rest underground in aquifers for thousands or even millions of years. When changes in the surrounding geology seal the aquifer off from further replenishment, the water becomes trapped within and is known as fossil water. Fossil water is, by definition, a non-renewable resource. Whereas most aquifers are naturally replenished by infiltration of water from precipitation, fossil aquifers are those that get little or no recharge.</Text>

Whereas most aquifers are naturally replenished by infiltration of water from precipitation, fossil aquifers are those that get little or no recharge. The extraction of water from such non-replenishing groundwater reserves (known as low safe-yield reserves) is known in hydrology as water mining.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System is among the most notable of fossil water reserves. Fossil aquifers also exist in the Sahara, the Kalahari, and the Ogallala underlying the US Great Plains. A further potential store of ancient water is Lake Vostok, a subglacial lake in Antarctica.</Text>
